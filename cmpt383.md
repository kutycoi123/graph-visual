## How to get the project working?
1. vagrant up
2. Open on browser: http://localhost:3000                                     
## Features
1. Interactive UI: Users can create, delete, move nodes and edges of a graph
2. Backends (Python and Golang servers) execute graph algorithms correctly and efficiently
3. Frontend displays graph algorithms in a iterative and accurate way.
